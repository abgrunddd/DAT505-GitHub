My artistic work's named Earth.
I want to deliever in this work is that I hope the earth can be colorful even in the universe.That's why I put so many little pointlights rotating around the earth.To make the earth look more real, I added highlights layer and clouds layer to its surface.

The final folder includes Audio,build,js,Texture,index.html.
